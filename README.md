Geometric scattering coefficients could be used for various downstream tasks, and in the paper we considered four of them, namely graph classification of social network datasets, graph classification under low training data availability, dimention reduction and data exploration of ENZYME dataset. 

## Graph Classification of Social Network Datasets

There are seven social network datasets commonly used for graph classification: IMDB-B, IMDB-M, REDDIT-B, REDDIT-M, 

## Graph Classification Under Low Training Data Availability
